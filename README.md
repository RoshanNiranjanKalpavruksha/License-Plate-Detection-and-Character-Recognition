License Plate Detection and Character Recognition

This paper presents a method for license plate recognition through analysis of vehicle images. Accurate location of license plate and extracting characters of plate are implemented.  License plate is detected and characters in it is detected and the result is printed both on the console and the image. At last, characters extraction is done by using open cv.. And the extraction characters are matched with the templates. Experimental results show that this approach can recognize license plates more effectively and establish a good technical base for the future advanced license plate recognition.
